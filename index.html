		<h1>What is GNU?</h1>
		<a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> is an operating system and an extensive collection of software that forms part of what people refer to as the GNU plus Linux operating system (or erroneously just Linux).<br> <br>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a> announced the GNU project in 1983. The operating system was to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a> replacement to the proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a> operating system. <br> <br>
		In 1992 the GNU operating system almost had the entirety of its components created, however one critical part was missing, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernel</a>.
		<h1>What is Linux?</h1>
		<a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a> is a kernel and is not an operating system unto itself, instead is a critical component in the GNU plus Linux operating system. <br> <br>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> began development on the Linux kernel in 1991 after frustrations relating to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX">MINIX</a> licensing at the time. The Linux kernel was originally licensed to prohibit commercial redistribution. <br> <br>
		In 1992 Linus liberated his kernel relicensing it under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU GPL</a>. Now under a free licence and considered free software, the Linux kernel and GNU operating system, along with it's extensive collection of software can pair in a mutually beneficial relationship.
		<h2>Combined, they form an entire operating system as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> known as GNU plus Linux.<h2> <br> <br>
